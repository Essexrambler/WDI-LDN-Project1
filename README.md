# WDI-LDN-Project1
First project on WDI London course week 2.

#London Landmarks Memory Game.#

##First Project - based on creating a small game.

###Installation Instructions.

Game is hosted on Heroku at this url:
http://desolate-mountain-49112.herokuapp.com
An imaged based Memory game aimed at London landmarks, with my own Photographs incorporated into the board.

##Tools uses##
*HTML 
*CSS 
*JAVASCRIPT
*GITHUB

##Planning:

I started with some plain paper and pen and put down some basic idea's and quickly came up with a solid idea.
I then started to mock up my idea using Trello and the tools kit, showing imagery and layout of the basic game board, also used some photoshop to edit and render my photos before use on the game board.

###Methodology:
I set out on Lunchtime of day one, with the above plan, and by the evening of day one had a solid plan of the process and how I was going to implement the idea.

I layed down some basic Logic and knew in my head how the win function and basis of the game would work, in my mind this was the easy part of the process, but still key to get some solid planning and logic in place to follow and remind myself of the path I needed to stick to throughout the 4 days. (psuedo code)

###Process
After setting up out Heroku and hosting platforms for the first project, I set out my **HTML, CSS AND APP/JS** platforms ready for coding to begin.

I initially started to build a basic Board using a simple **HTML** platform of tags and and with some quick styling had a square board **4 x 4** in which to hold my 8 paired images I planned to use for the Main part of the game logic.

My first Issues came quickly, as I soon realised my Raw files I was going to swap for Jpeg's would not fit, I solved this problem by rendering them in **Photoshop** allowing me to keep the image resolution and quality to a high spec.

Once the basic structure and plan was set down I then went about applying the first parts of the logic in **Javascript**. I wrote some basic statements to call in **JS** and went about attaching my Images to the card **Id's** I had numerically ordered in **HTML**.

###Problems solved
I hit some real barriers and stumbling blocks in this process, none more so than in **Javascript** code, I tried to follow my win logic as close to my plan as possible, but this won't always allow for changes in Ideas when it comes to Long lines of code written, Ive learnt to try refract what I write to save time and Memory.

Possilbly my biggest hurdle was a **Shuffle Function** I put into the game logic at the end, to reset the game cards and shuffle them randomly around the board.
I couldn't get the function to work for 2 days, I dissected the code and even deleted parts to work to enable it to work, I finally got it working on the last day, Hours before the Close of Play in **GA** HQ, this was undoubtedly the most pleasing part of the build, to finally get some Key part of the game working after hours/Days reading and re-writing code was so Gratifying.
